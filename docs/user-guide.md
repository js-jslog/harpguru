# Right hand side menus

Down the right hand side of the screen are 7 menu tabs. The black tabs with grey icons are pull-out menu's which offer settings, the black tabs with yellow icons are quick action buttons, and the black tab with pink numbers is a page selection button.

I'll run through the purpose of each of these now, from top to bottom:

## 1. The covariance menu

That's a complicated sounding name but don't worry. This menu allows you to select harmonica key, position and song key. As you might already know, if you change one of these then one other will change and one will stay the same.

For example, if we have a C harmonica, we can be playing in first position for songs in C. If we change position to second position, we'll now be playing songs in G. Similarly, if we now change to an F harmonica but we want to still be playing a song in G, we need to change position to 3rd.

There is a detailed video describing how to use this menu on [ the Harp Guru YouTube channel. ](https://youtu.be/uRWvHPh0NZw)

## 2. The settings menu

The settings menu contains 3 sub-menus which can be navigated using the up and down arrows above and below the sub-menu title. The three sub-menus functions are defined here:

### 2.1 The tuning sub-menu

Most people won't need to touch this, but if you have an alternate tuned harmonica, like country tuning, then this is where you can select that tuning. It will modify the layout you'll see in the harp visualisation in the centre of the screen (called the harp face).

### 2.2 The valving sub-menu

Related, but distinct from the tuning sub-menu is the valving sub-menu. If your harmonica setup is half-valved then you can add those valves in from here, altering the bends available for a given tuning.

### 2.3 The zoom sub-menu

If you're using a small screen or trying to look at a long harp then being able to focus in on a reduced number of holes might be a relief. After you select the number of holes that you want to display here, a scroll bar will appear on the left hand side of the screen. It is a vertical scroll bar which will control the horizontal scroll along the harpface. A horizontal scroll bar would have been too detrimental to the screen space available.

A top and bottom range number is presented on the scroll bar to indicate which holes are currently visible.

## 3. The scales & chords menu

Select from a predefined list of popular scales and chords / intervals.

## 4. Pitches / degrees

You'll notice that Harp Guru gives you two perspectives on things. One in the harp face, and another in a legend up the left hand side. One of those will present pitches and the other will present degrees. The orientation you choose here can also be important when you are modifying settings in the "covariance menu" described above. When you change harp key, position or song key, either the pitches or the scale degrees highlighted have to change. The app will choose which of these to maintain based on which one is currently represented on the harp face. This will be much easier to demonstrate in a video but have a play and see if you can make sense of it.

## 5. Fragmentation

By default the harp face is fragmented at the octave points. This can make it easier to comprehend what you're looking at. Notice that as you change position the location of the fragmentation changes, because your root note location moves around the harp face. This view can hold you back from full mastery of the layout though, because it's giving you a clue about the harmonica which doesn't actually exist. So if you press this button the fragmentation will disappear and you will be challenged a bit more. This is most relevant in quiz mode (described next). There is a detailed video on this feature on [ the Harp Guru YouTube channel. ](https://youtu.be/J6vIIqCZqfo)

## 6. Mode selection

By default you are in "explore" mode which just means you can interact with the harp face however you want. When you press this button you will toggle in to "quiz" mode where the app will present you a scale degree (or pitch depending on which of the modes in point 3 above you have selected) and challenge you to point it out on the harp face. It's a simple but effective way of challenging your memory of the harmonica layout.

## 7. Page selection

Harp Guru gives you 3 pages of harp faces to interact with. This is useful if you are playing a song in 3 different positions for example and don't want a quick way to switch between harp face setups. I'm often only using the first page, but when I need the other 2 it's really useful.
