## Check the YouTube channel

The primary source of information is the [Harp Guru YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_uFG-i4MZeFE3JYoFv0R0A).

You may benefit from reading this document first, as a very basic introduction to the functionality of the menu interface on the right hand side of the app.

However, all detailed usage is best described through demonstration, which is why the videos have been provided on [the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_uFG-i4MZeFE3JYoFv0R0A).

## Overview of the menus

From the list of menus on the right hand side, and writing from top to bottom:

1. The covariance menu - that's a complicated sounding name but don't worry. This menu allows you to select harmonica key, position and song key. As you might already know, if you change one of these then one other will change and one will stay the same. For example, if we have a C harmonica, we can be playing in first position for songs in C. If we change position to second position, we'll now be playing songs in G. Similarly, if we now change to an F harmonica but we want to still be playing a song in G, we need to change position to 3rd. The video demonstrating how this works is at https://youtu.be/uRWvHPh0NZw

2. The tuning menu - most people won't need to touch this, but if you have an alternate tuned harmonica, like country tuning, then this is where you can select that tuning. It will modify the layout you'll see in the harp visualisation in the centre of the screen (called the harp face). You can also set up whether you're harp is half-valved or not. And there is also a zoom option here which will be useful if you are looking at a long harp on a small screen.

3. The scales and chords menu - here you will find a list of popular scales and chords. Selecting them here will highlight that scale on the harpface, and if you manually select a scale on the harpface you will see it highlighted in this menu. There is also a menu here for selecting which of the notes to include in the quiz mode (see below).

4. Pitches / degrees - you'll notice that Harp Guru gives you two perspectives on things. One in the harp face, and another in a legend up the left hand side. One of those will present pitches and the other will present degrees. The orientation you choose here can also be important when you are modifying settings in the "covariance menu" described above. When you change harp key, position or song key, either the pitches or the scale degrees highlighted have to change. The app will choose which of these to maintain based on which one is currently represented on the harp face. This will be much easier to demonstrate in a video but have a play and see if you can make sense of it.

5. Fragmentation - by default the harp face is fragmented at the octave points. This can make it easier to comprehend what you're looking at. Notice that as you change position the location of the fragmentation changes, because your root note location moves around the harp face. This view can hold you back from full mastery of the layout though, because it's giving you a clue about the harmonica which doesn't actually exist. So if you press this button the fragmentation will disappear and you will be challenged a bit more. This is most relevant in quiz mode (described next). There is a video on fragmentation at https://youtu.be/J6vIIqCZqfo.

6. Mode selection - by default you are in "explore" mode which just means you can interact with the harp face however you want. When you press this button you will toggle in to "quiz" mode where the app will present you a scale degree (or pitch depending on which of the modes in point 3 above you have selected) and challenge you to point it out on the harp face. It's a simple but effective way of challenging your memory of the harmonica layout.

7. Page selection - Harp Guru gives you 3 pages of harp faces to interact with. This is useful if you are playing a song in 3 different positions for example and don't want a quick way to switch between harp face setups. I'm often only using the first page, but when I need the other 2 it's really useful.
