# Developer documentation

The documentation for this project exists at this point only to explain the technical detail for potentially non-obvious features of the monorepo project as a whole for the benefit of developers.

For details on the API's and what to expect when _using_ the packages, please view the appropriate README.md files in each package root.

# User documentation

It would be preferable to put this documentation in a more customer friendly place. But for now it is here and I just need to make it clear that this is aimed at the end user rather than the developer (which is the main intended target of documentation in this folder).
