# HarpGuru

A react native application without boilerplate designed to be run inside, for example, an expo project.

# Split from HarpNative

This project was imported in to this monorepo from a previous isolated project called HarpNative. At the time of the split, the version was returned to 0.1.0. As you'll be able to tell from the other packages split apart in thie monorepo since then, I now think that this is a mistake; but you live and learn.

[This is the pull request with all of the commits relating to the move to a monorepo architecture](https://github.com/js-jslog/harpnative/pull/72)
